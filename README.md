# blockchain monitor
This is the skeleton of a Node.js project I was working on to visualize transaction volume passing through the bitcoin blockchain on a day to day basis. So far, it scans active bitcoin blockchain ledger transactions and highlights the highest value transactions. The server.js returns these high-value transactions that went through during the monitoring period in an arrray.

This data will eventually be passed to a chart system for visualization- considering using this as learning oppurtunity for chart.js.
